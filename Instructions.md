# What Could Go Wrong? - LLM Edition

### Gameplay Instructions

**Getting Started:**
* The game is designed for 3 or more players.
* Each player needs a stack of event cards (marked with the reply icon ðŸ”„) and a way to track points (pen and paper or a scoring system).

**Gameplay:**
1. **Deal Cards:** Each player draws 5 event cards and keeps them face down.
2. **Choose the Card Czar:** Determine the first player (e.g., roll a die). This player becomes the Card Czar.
3. **Draw a Prompt Card:** The Card Czar draws a single prompt card (marked with the tasks icon ðŸ“‹) and reads it aloud.
4. **Play Event Cards:** Each player selects one event card from their hand that best relates to the prompt and places it face down on the table.
5. **Reveal and Discuss:** The Card Czar collects all event cards, shuffles them, and reveals them one by one, reading aloud. 
6. **Choose the Winning Event Card:** The Card Czar selects the event card they find most interesting or relevant to the prompt. The player who played that card scores 1 point.
7. **Group Discussion:** Discuss the prompt and the chosen event card. Players can earn bonus points for insightful comments or ideas.
8. **Start a New Round:** After discussion, the next player becomes the Card Czar, and a new round begins. Players replenish their hands to 5 cards.

**Winning:**
* There is no set number of rounds. Players can continue playing as long as desired. The player with the most points at the end wins.

**Tips:**
* Be creative with card choices.
* Encourage humor and silliness.
* Engage in thoughtful discussion.
* Listen to others' ideas and be respectful.



### Additional rules"
If you want to change the rules of the games here is some idea to have a funnier experiences:

#### 1. Expansion of Event Cards:
   - Before the game begins, players collectively create a set of custom event cards. Each player contributes a certain number of cards (e.g., 5 cards per player), adding diversity and personalization to the game.

#### 2. Risky Plays:
   - Introduce a "Risky Play" option: Once per round, a player can choose to play two event cards instead of one. If the Card Czar selects one of their cards, they earn 2 points, but if neither of their cards is chosen, they lose a point.

#### 3. Wild Prompt Round:
   - Designate one round per game as a "Wild Prompt Round." In this round, the Card Czar draws three prompt cards instead of one. Players must select an event card that fits at least one of the three prompts. The Card Czar then selects the winning card based on its relevance to any of the three prompts.

#### 4. Role Reversal:
   - Implement a "Role Reversal" mechanic: Once a player reaches a certain point threshold (e.g., 5 points), they become the Card Czar for the next round, regardless of the usual rotation. This adds unpredictability and keeps all players engaged.

#### 5. Collaboration Bonus:
   - Introduce a "Collaboration Bonus": If two or more players play event cards that complement each other exceptionally well (as decided by group consensus), each contributing player earns an additional point. This encourages teamwork and creative synergy.

#### 6. Double Down:
   - Allow players to "Double Down" on their chosen event card: After the Card Czar selects a winning card, the player who played it can opt to sacrifice one point in exchange for doubling their score for that round. This high-risk, high-reward strategy adds excitement to the game.

#### 7. Event Card Auction:
   - Before each round, players have the option to bid points to access additional event cards from a communal pool. The highest bidder gains access to the extra cards, potentially increasing their chances of winning the round. However, the bid amount is deducted from their total score regardless of the outcome.

#### 8. Time Pressure:
   - Introduce a time limit for selecting event cards (e.g., 30 seconds per player). If a player fails to choose a card within the allotted time, they forfeit their turn for that round, and their hand size decreases by one card for the next round.

#### 9. Theme Rounds:
   - Designate specific rounds as "Theme Rounds" where all event cards played must relate to a particular theme chosen at random (e.g., space exploration, medieval times, futuristic technology). This adds variety and challenges players to think creatively within constraints.

#### 10. Community Voting:
   - After the Card Czar selects a winning card, allow all players (including the Card Czar) to vote on their favorite event card anonymously. The player whose card receives the most votes earns an additional point, fostering inclusivity and rewarding creativity from all participants.
